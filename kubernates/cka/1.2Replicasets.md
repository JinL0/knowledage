## Question 5: What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set?
busybox-pod

```
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl describe replicaset new-replica-set
Name:         new-replica-set
Namespace:    default
Selector:     name=busybox-pod
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>
Replicas:     4 current / 4 desired
Pods Status:  0 Running / 4 Waiting / 0 Succeeded / 0 Failed
Pod Template:
  Labels:  name=busybox-pod
  Containers:
   busybox-container:
    Image:      busybox777
    Port:       <none>
    Host Port:  <none>
    Command:
      sh
      -c
      echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 3600
    Environment:  <none>
    Mounts:       <none>

```

## Question 6: How many PODs are READY in the new-replica-set?
0

## Question 7: Why do you think the PODs are not ready?
The image BUSYBOX777 doesn't exist

## Question 8: Delete any one of the 4 PODs.
```
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl delete pod new-replica-set-wdmlg
pod "new-replica-set-wdmlg" deleted
```

## Question 9: How many PODs exist now?
4

## Question 10: Why are there still 4 PODs, even after you deleted one?
ReplicaSet ensures that desired number of PODs always run

## Question 11: Create a ReplicaSet using the replicaset-definition-1.yaml file located at /root/.

```
The value for apiVersion is incorrect. Correct the apiVersion for ReplicaSet.

Run the command: You can check for apiVersion of replicaset by command kubectl api-resources | grep replicaset

kubectl explain replicaset | grep VERSION and correct the apiVersion for ReplicaSet. should be apps/v1

Then run the command: kubectl create -f /root/replicaset-definition-1.yaml
```

## Question 12: Fix the issue in the replicaset-definition-2.yaml file and create a ReplicaSet using it.


This file is located at /root/.

```
spec:
  # modify replicas according to your case
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
```
name in the `selector/matchLabels` should match the template/metadata/labels/tier

## Question 13: Fix the original replica set new-replica-set to use the correct busybox image.


Either delete and recreate the ReplicaSet or Update the existing ReplicaSet and then delete all PODs, so new ones with the correct image will be created.


```
kubectl edit replicaset new-replica-set
```

## Question 14: Now scale the ReplicaSet down to 2 PODs.


Use the kubectl scale command or edit the replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset.

```
kubectl edit replicaset
```
