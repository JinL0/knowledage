# Binary Search 
Leetcode [post](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/786126/python-powerful-ultimate-binary-search-template-solved-many-problems)
## Binary Search Template 
```python3
def binary_search(array) -> int:
    def condition(value) -> bool:
        pass

    left, right = min(search_space), max(search_space) # could be [0, n], [1, n] etc. Depends on problem
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if condition(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
```
### key points
- Correctly initialize the boundary variables `left` and `right` to specify search space. Only one rule: set up the boundary to **include all possible elements**;
- Decide return value. Is it `return left` or `return left - 1`? Remember this: after exiting the while loop, left is the `minimal k`â€‹ satisfying the condition function;
- Design the `condition` function. This is the most difficult and most beautiful part. Needs lots of practice.
